# What happens when you type a URL into your browser?

## The diagram below illustrates the steps.

### 1. Bob enters a URL into the browser and hits Enter. In this example, the URL is composed of 4 parts:

1) 🔹 scheme - 𝒉𝒕𝒕𝒑://. This tells the browser to send a connection to the server using HTTP.
2) 🔹 domain - 𝒆𝒙𝒂𝒎𝒑𝒍𝒆.𝒄𝒐𝒎. This is the domain name of the site.
3) 🔹 path - 𝒑𝒓𝒐𝒅𝒖𝒄𝒕/𝒆𝒍𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒓𝒊𝒄. It is the path on the server to the requested resource: phone.
4) 🔹 resource - 𝒑𝒉𝒐𝒏𝒆. It is the name of the resource Bob wants to visit.

### 2. The browser looks up the IP address for the domain with a domain name system (DNS) lookup. To make the lookup process fast, data is cached at different layers:
 - browser cache
 - OS cache
 - local network cache
 - and ISP cache. 

2.1 If the IP address cannot be found at any of the caches, the browser goes to DNS servers to do a recursive DNS lookup until the IP address is found. 

### 3. Now that we have the IP address of the server, the browser establishes a TCP connection with the server.

### 4. The browser sends an HTTP request to the server. The request looks like this:

𝘎𝘌𝘛 /𝘱𝘩𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘏𝘛𝘛𝘗/1.1
𝘏𝘰𝘴𝘵: 𝘦𝘹𝘢𝘮𝘱𝘭𝘦.𝘤𝘰𝘮

### 5. The server processes the request and sends back the response. For a successful response (the status code is 200). The HTML response might look like this: 

𝘏𝘛𝘛𝘗/1.1 200 𝘖𝘒
𝘋𝘢𝘵𝘦: 𝘚𝘶𝘯, 30 𝘑𝘢𝘯 2022 00:01:01 𝘎𝘔𝘛
𝘚𝘦𝘳𝘷𝘦𝘳: 𝘈𝘱𝘢𝘤𝘩𝘦
𝘊𝘰𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘯𝘵-𝘛𝘺𝘱𝘦: 𝘵𝘦𝘹𝘵/𝘩𝘵𝘮𝘭; 𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘳𝘴𝘦𝘵=𝘶𝘵𝘧-8

<!𝘋𝘖𝘊𝘛𝘠𝘗𝘌 𝘩𝘵𝘮𝘭>
<𝘩𝘵𝘮𝘭 𝘭𝘢𝘯𝘨="𝘦𝘯">
𝘏𝘦𝘭𝘭𝘰 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘭𝘥
</𝘩𝘵𝘮𝘭>

### 6. The browser renders the HTML content.
